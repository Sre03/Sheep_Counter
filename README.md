# Sheep_Counter
Question:
  Imagine a flock of sheep, one by one moving in and out of a fenced grassland.
Now the shepherd wants a device attached to the fence door that keeps track of the number of sheep inside the land.
So your task is to create a Tinkercad simulation of a device that is suitable for this job.
Once done with your Tinkercad simulation and briefly describe it in the "Readme" file of your GitHub repo.

Components used :
  Arduino Uno
  2 ultrasonic distance sensors (4 pins)

Sensor 1 (Sheep enter) detects sheep entering through the gate
Sensor 2 (Sheep exit) detects sheep exiting through the gate
Successfully counted the number of sheep entering and exiting a gated grassland.
